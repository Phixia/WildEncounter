import random, sys, sqlite3, getopt
from collections import Counter

sys.path.insert(0, "modules/")

from monmods import GetNature
from monmods import Shiny
from monmods import RareRoll
from nature import Nature
from pokemon import Pokemon

# To call this program do the following from CLI python pokemon.py PokemonName(Currently Cap sensitive) Level

mon = sys.argv[1]
